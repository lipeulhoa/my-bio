            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p class="center-this">I am a motivated young professional, with graphic design and computer science training. I am originally from Brazil but I immigrated to Canada 5 years ago. I currently live in Mississauga and on my second year of the Interaction Design program at George Brown College. I love technology and I'm always up to date with the latest and greatest in the world of smartphones and video games. I have decided to create a virtual portfolio in order to share my best work with the world.</p>

         <h2>Information Architecture Course</h2>
         <p class="highlight">Improving the organization and presentation of your website or mobile application information will increase user satisfaction and engagement. The information architecture of your site or app should be structured to mirror how your users think, making their experience clear and seamless. The <strong>Information Architecture</strong> course provides an introduction to the methods used to research user interactions and analyze the results and to create a validated information architecture. Learn the fundamentals of user experience design and how to create deliverables – including a user journey map, card sort, site map, user flows, storyboards and wireframes – from industry experts.</p>

         <h2 class="interaction-design-program">Interaction Design Program</h2>
         <p class="interaction-design-program-paragraph">Interaction Design is an interdisciplinary field merging design skills such as user experience, interface development and graphic design with programming to create meaningful experiences between the user, digital and physical platforms, such as websites, wearables and mobile devices.
            Modified by the psychological, social, economic and cultural factors that shape our present and future world, this ever-evolving field envisions new ways of human-computer interaction within systems, services, products and spaces across multiple industries.
            Throughout the Interaction Design program, students will be expected to address such topics as mixed realities, immersive environments, usability, spatial relations and human factors. An emphasis on usability testing, research, collaboration and real-world projects distinguish this program.
